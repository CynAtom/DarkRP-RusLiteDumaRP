	"info" "[h1][b]This addon was not designed for TTT. DarkRP works with minor changes to settings, such as default clips, weapon stripping. See the description for info on how to adjust these settings to fit your needs.[/b][/h1]

Included in this addon:
Ammo boxes which can explode if damaged.

Selective Fire: Some weapons can now change between full automatic and semi automatic.
Hold Use (default E) and hit Reload to select auto or semi-auto.

[b]Optional Empty Weapon Stripping: Weapons with no ammo left will be dropped. Use the console command M9KWeaponStrip. Weapon stripping is disabled by default, and shame on me for not doing it earlier.[/b]

[b]Optional Gas Effects when firing your weapon. Use the console command M9KGasEffect. If you are using an older computer or lag severely when firing, disable the effect.[/b]
[h1]To disable gas effects for all users on your server, use the console command [b]M9KClientGasDisable 1[/b]. You can re-enable gas effects for clients by using the console command [b]M9KClientGasDisable 0[/b].[/h1]

[b]Optional Dynamic Recoil: Recoil now will push your aiming direction. You will notice your aim being pushed upward after each shot. Don't like it? Use the console command M9KdynamicRecoil. [/b]

[b]Optional Bullet Penetration: Disable the penetration and ricochet, as well as their effects. Use the console command M9KDisablePenetration.[/b]

[b]Optional Ammo Box Detonation: You can decide whether my ammo boxes go kaboom or not. Use the console command M9KAmmoDetonation.[/b].

[b]Customizable Damage Multiplier: Use the console command M9KDamageMultiplier to scale up (or down!) M9K bullet damage.[/b]

[b]Customizable Default Clips: Use the console command M9KDefaultClip to select how many default clips weapons will spawn with.[/b]

[b]The Davy Crockett is the only weapon that has a different blacklist command. To disable the Davy Crockett, use the console command DavyCrockettAllowed.[/b]

[b]Nerve Gas uses explosions to deal damage. If you'd rather disable this and use POINT_HURT instead, use the console command M9KExplosiveNerveGas.[/b]

[b]Setting Davy Crockett to Admin Only: set the console variable DavyCrocketAdminOnly to 1 and reload the map. The weapon will only be spawnable for admins.The M9K Administration addon also has a convenient button for this setting.[/b]

[b]Setting Orbital Strike to Admin Only: set the console variable OrbitalStrikeAdminOnly to 1 and reload the map. The weapon will only be spawnable for admins. The M9K Administration addon also has a convenient button for this setting.[/b]

-------------------------------------------------
The weapons in this addon do not support custom playermodel hands. I tried to implement this feature, but the models broke when I decompile them.
-------------------------------------------------
I've made the weapon base public, so now you can make weapons of your own!
