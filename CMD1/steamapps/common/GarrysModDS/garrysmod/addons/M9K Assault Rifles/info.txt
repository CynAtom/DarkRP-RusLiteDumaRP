	"info" "[h1][b]This addon was not designed for TTT. DarkRP works with minor changes to settings, such as default clips, weapon stripping. See the description for info on how to adjust these settings to fit your needs.[/b][/h1]

Included in this addon:
Ammo boxes which can explode if damaged.

Selective Fire: Some weapons can now change between full automatic and semi automatic.
Hold Use (default E) and hit Reload to select auto or semi-auto.

Silencing (only available on select weapons): Hold Use (default E) and hit Alt Fire (default right click).

[b]Optional Empty Weapon Stripping: Weapons with no ammo left will be dropped. Use the console command M9KWeaponStrip. Weapon stripping is disabled by default, and shame on me for not doing it earlier.[/b]

[b]Optional Gas Effects when firing your weapon. Use the console command M9KGasEffect. If you are using an older computer or lag severely when firing, disable the effect.[/b]
[h1]To disable gas effects for all users on your server, use the console command [b]M9KClientGasDisable 1[/b]. You can re-enable gas effects for clients by using the console command [b]M9KClientGasDisable 0[/b].[/h1]

[b]Optional Dynamic Recoil: Recoil now will push your aiming direction. You will notice your aim being pushed upward after each shot. Don't like it? Use the console command M9KdynamicRecoil. [/b]

[b]Optional Bullet Penetration: Disable the penetration and ricochet, as well as their effects. Use the console command M9KDisablePenetration.[/b]

[b]Optional Ammo Box Detonation: You can decide whether my ammo boxes go kaboom or not. Use the console command M9KAmmoDetonation.[/b].

[b]Unique Weapon Slots: Use the console command M9KUniqueSlots if you would like to enable/disable unique slot numbers (and fast weapon switching) for each weapon. (And let me know if I missed one!)[/b]

[b]Customizable Damage Multiplier: Use the console command M9KDamageMultiplier to scale up (or down!) M9K bullet damage.[/b]

[b]Customizable Default Clips: Use the console command M9KDefaultClip to select how many default clips weapons will spawn with.[/b]

This addon does require CSS for hand textures, but you can find a suitable replacement here on the workshop. Garry has also included low-res fallback textures, so you should be able to play without looking at checkerboard hands.

Included are 19 weapons, listed and credited below.

-------------------------------------------------
The weapons in this addon do not support custom playermodel hands. I tried to implement this feature, but the models broke when I decompile them.
-------------------------------------------------
I don't think I will be making any more weapons. However, the weapon base is now public, so you can make them yourselves! Visit this link to download the base, and follow the instructions to start making your own weapons.
